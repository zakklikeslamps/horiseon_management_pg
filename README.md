**Version 1.0.1**
First Assignment: Refactoring Horiseon Management Page

Refactoring page's existing code to make it more accessible to variety of users & other developers. 

The page's html was modified & adjusted slightly to fix a broken link, add a "Back to Top" button, and 
adjust the overall view of the page. 

The page's css was modified to be more streamlined & readable to other developers; several compatible blocks that were spaced out & unorganized were compressed, restructured & properly organized to reflect the structrue of the html & the page as a whole.
